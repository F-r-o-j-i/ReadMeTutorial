## Tutorial for making a README.md

#### Titles/Subtitles
To create a title/subtitle you will need to add hashtags at the start of the line on which you want your title/subitle to be. The amount of hashtags you will have to put depends on how big you want your title/subtitle to be, the lesser amount of hashtags, the bigger the title/subtitle.

Example:
``## Test``

##### Emojis
To use emojis in your README.md you will have to press `Windows + .` if you are on windows and `Fn` on MacOS.
