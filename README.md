## Tutorial for making a README.md

#### Titles/Subtitles
To create a title/subtitle you will need to add hashtags at the start of the line on which you want your title/subitle to be. The amount of hashtags you will have to put depends on how big you want your title/subtitle to be, the lesser amount of hashtags, the bigger the title/subtitle.

Example:

``## Test``

#### Emojis
To use emojis in your README.md you will have to press `Windows + .` if you are on windows, whereas if you are on MacOS you will have to press `Fn`.

Example:

``ðŸ‘‹``

#### Embeds
To create an Embed, the simplest way to do so is `![](*Image URL goes here*)`, once you paste your image URL in the regular brackets the image will appear once you `Commit changes`. You can state what the embed is in the square brackets (`[]`).

Example:

``![Node JS Icon](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/7d7b100e379663ee40a20989e6c61737e6396c1dafc3a7c6d2ada8d4447eb0e4/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f6e6f64652e6a732d3644413535463f7374796c653d666f722d7468652d6261646765266c6f676f3d6e6f64652e6a73266c6f676f436f6c6f723d7768697465)``
